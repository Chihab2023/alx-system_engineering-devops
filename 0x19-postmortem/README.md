0. My first postmortem:                                              Incident Report / Postmortem

1. Issue Summary

Title: System Outage Affecting User Authentication
Date: april 12, 2024
Duration: 2 hours (14:00 - 16:00 UTC)
Impact: Users were unable to authenticate, resulting in service disruption for 90% of active users. Approximately 50,000 users experienced login failures during this period.
Detection: Automated monitoring systems alerted on elevated authentication failure rates.

2. Timeline

13:55 UTC: Deployment of new authentication microservice begins.
14:00 UTC: Automated monitoring alerts triggered by a spike in authentication failures.
14:05 UTC: Engineering team begins investigation into the alerts.
14:15 UTC: Initial assessment points to recent deployment as potential cause.
14:30 UTC: Rollback of the new authentication microservice deployment initiated.
14:45 UTC: Rollback completed, but issues persist.
15:00 UTC: Deeper investigation reveals database connection pool exhaustion.
15:20 UTC: Database connection pool size increased and configuration tuned.
15:45 UTC: Authentication services begin to recover.
16:00 UTC: Monitoring indicates normal operation resumed.

3. Root Cause Analysis

The primary cause was a misconfiguration in the newly deployed authentication microservice.
The microservice had an incorrect database connection pool setting, which led to connection pool exhaustion.
Connection pool exhaustion caused the service to be unable to handle incoming authentication requests, resulting in failures.
The rollback of the microservice was not sufficient to restore service as the database connection pool was already exhausted and required manual intervention.

4. Resolution and Recovery

Immediate rollback of the new authentication microservice deployment was performed.
Investigation into database connection issues identified connection pool exhaustion.
Manual intervention to increase the database connection pool size and tune related configurations was performed.
Continuous monitoring to ensure the system returned to normal operation.
Full recovery was confirmed with normal authentication request processing.

5. Corrective and Preventative Measures

Code Review: Implement stricter code review processes to ensure configuration settings are correctly specified.
Testing: Enhance pre-deployment testing to include connection pool stress tests.
Monitoring: Improve monitoring and alerting to detect database connection pool issues more rapidly.
Documentation: Update documentation on microservice configuration, especially regarding database connection settings.
Training: Conduct training sessions for engineers on the importance of configuration management and database connection handling.
Automation: Develop automated scripts to quickly adjust database connection pools in response to similar incidents.

Note: Imagine a whimsical diagram here showing a tiny, panicked server running around, with a giant red "AUTH ERROR" sign looming overhead, while engineers with wrenches and coffee cups scramble around to fix it.

1. Issue Summary

Title: The Great Authentication Meltdown of 2024
Date: June 20, 2024
Duration: 2 hours (14:00 - 16:00 UTC)
Impact: Approximately 50,000 users thought their passwords had been hijacked by aliens. Spoiler: It was just us.
Detection: Our vigilant robot overlords (automated monitoring systems) screamed in digital agony due to a sudden surge in authentication failures.

2. Timeline

13:55 UTC: Innocent deployment of our shiny new authentication microservice begins. üçÄ
14:00 UTC: Alarm bells! Authentication failures spike! üò±
14:05 UTC: Engineering team assembles, slightly caffeinated. ‚òï
14:15 UTC: Fingers pointed at the recent deployment. üîç
14:30 UTC: Rollback of the new authentication microservice initiated. üöÄ
14:45 UTC: Rollback complete. Problem not complete. ü§î
15:00 UTC: Deeper digging reveals the true villain: database connection pool exhaustion. üòà
15:20 UTC: Connection pool size increased. Take that, villain! üõ†Ô∏è
15:45 UTC: Authentication services begin to recover. Phew! üòÖ
16:00 UTC: Normal operations resume. Heroes celebrated. üéâ

3. Root Cause Analysis

Villain Identified: A sneaky misconfiguration in the new authentication microservice.
Details: The microservice had the wrong database connection pool settings, leading to exhaustion (it was all tuckered out).
Consequence: Service couldn't handle the influx of authentication requests, leading to widespread failures.
Complication: Rollback didn‚Äôt fix it because the database connection pool was already out of commission and needed manual rebooting.

4. Resolution and Recovery

Initial Action: Rollback the microservice deployment.
Diagnosis: Pinpointed the exhaustion of the database connection pool.
Remedy: Manually expanded the connection pool size and tweaked configurations.
Monitoring: Kept a close eye until the system was back on its feet.
Victory Declared: Service fully restored by 16:00 UTC.

5. Corrective and Preventative Measures

Code Review: Double-check all settings, because configuration gremlins are real.
Testing: Stress test those connection pools like a server gym session.
Monitoring: Better alerts for database connection fatigue (because even databases need naps).
Documentation: Update the "how not to break things" guide, especially on database settings.
Training: Engineer bootcamp on the fine art of configuration and connection handling.
Automation: Scripts that auto-magically adjust connection pools during crises (robots to the rescue!).
